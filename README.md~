Synthesis of CEP-machine by machine learning method



Problem Statement and Key Hypothesis
To answer on the principal question posed in the previous section of the
paper in this section we formulate the key hypothesis of our study.
The methods of interpolation functions inspired us to formulate the is-
sued below hypothesis. To substantiate a particular interpolation method
the following reasoning is generally accepted: we demonstrate that the in-
terpolation method being studied gives the exact solution for some class
of function (e.g., for polynomials). This consideration explains why the
method can be used.
In our case the role of class of functions plays the class of regular
prefix-free languages for some fixed alphabet, and the method builds the
finite prefix-free acceptor based on two finite sets of words, one of them
contains words belonging to the language, and another contains words
not belonging to the language.
Thus, we formulate the problem: to find a method that provides
synthesis of a finite prefix-free acceptor on the base of two finite
sets of words â€“ the set of correct words (the set of examples)
and the set of incorrect words (the set of counterexamples).
Hypothesis. For any regular prefix set there exist a finite set of example
and a finite set of counterexamples such that the method gives the exact
solution, i.e. it restores the original set or, more precisely, the minimal
finite acceptor that recognises the original set.
